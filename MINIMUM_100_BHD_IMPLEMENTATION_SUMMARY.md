# Minimum 100 BHD Rule Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

I have successfully implemented the minimum 100 BHD rule across all cost calculation functions in the warehouse management system. Here's what was updated:

### 1. **Warehouse Detail Page** (`src/app/warehouses/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added minimum 100 BHD rule to the `calculateOccupantCost` function
- Any calculated monthly cost below 100 BHD is automatically set to 100 BHD
- Applied to both Very Short and regular (Short/Long) term calculations

### 2. **Admin Occupant Costs API** (`src/app/api/admin/occupant-costs/route.ts`)
- Updated the `calculateOccupantCost` method in the `OccupantCostCalculator` class
- Monthly costs below 100 BHD are automatically adjusted to 100 BHD
- Annual costs are recalculated based on the adjusted monthly cost

### 3. **Supporter Users Costs API** (`src/app/api/supporter/users-costs/route.ts`)
- Updated the `calculateUserCost` method in the `UserCostCalculator` class
- Monthly costs below 100 BHD are automatically adjusted to 100 BHD
- Annual costs are recalculated based on the adjusted monthly cost

### 4. **Main Warehouse Calculator** (`src/lib/sitra-calculator.ts`)
- The main calculator already had minimum charge logic using system settings
- Created `update-minimum-charge-100.sql` to update the system setting to 100 BHD

### 5. **Session Validation for Login Page** (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)
- Added session validation to prevent logged-in users from accessing the login page
- Checks for valid session tokens and redirects users to appropriate dashboards based on their role
- Shows loading state while checking session validity
- Clears invalid session data automatically

## 🔧 How the Minimum 100 BHD Rule Works

### Implementation Logic:
```javascript
// Apply minimum 100 BHD rule
const MINIMUM_CHARGE = 100
if (monthlyCost < MINIMUM_CHARGE) {
  monthlyCost = MINIMUM_CHARGE
  totalCost = MINIMUM_CHARGE * leaseDurationMonths
}
```

### Example Scenarios:
- **10m² user**: Calculated cost might be 35 BHD → Automatically adjusted to 100 BHD
- **15m² user**: Calculated cost might be 52.5 BHD → Automatically adjusted to 100 BHD  
- **50m² user**: Calculated cost might be 175 BHD → Remains 175 BHD (above minimum)
- **100m² user**: Calculated cost might be 350 BHD → Remains 350 BHD (above minimum)

## 📋 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `update-minimum-charge-100.sql` - Updates system settings to use 100 BHD minimum
- `test-minimum-100-bhd-rule.js` - Test script to verify the implementation
- `MINIMUM_100_BHD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files:
- `src/app/warehouses/[id]/page.tsx` - Added minimum 100 BHD rule
- `src/app/api/admin/occupant-costs/route.ts` - Added minimum 100 BHD rule
- `src/app/api/supporter/users-costs/route.ts` - Added minimum 100 BHD rule
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Added session validation

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. **Update System Settings**
Run the SQL script to update the minimum charge setting:
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO system_settings (setting_key, setting_value, description) VALUES
('minimum_charge', '100', 'Minimum monthly charge in BHD - updated to 100 BHD')
ON CONFLICT (setting_key) DO UPDATE SET
  setting_value = '100',
  description = 'Minimum monthly charge in BHD - updated to 100 BHD',
  updated_at = NOW();
```

### 2. **Test Small Area Calculations**
- Create a user with a small warehouse space (e.g., 10m², 15m², 25m²)
- Check the cost calculations in:
  - Admin panel occupant costs
  - Supporter dashboard user costs
  - Warehouse detail page occupant costs
- Verify that all costs show 100 BHD minimum

### 3. **Test Session Validation**
- Login to the system with any user
- Try to navigate to `/login` page
- Verify that you are automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on your role

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Cost Calculations:
- All users with small warehouse spaces will see 100 BHD as their monthly cost
- Users with larger spaces will see their calculated costs (if above 100 BHD)
- The rule applies consistently across all dashboards and cost displays

### Session Validation:
- Logged-in users cannot access the login page
- Automatic redirection to appropriate dashboards:
  - ADMIN/MANAGER → `/warehouses`
  - SUPPORT → `/supporter`  
  - USER → `/dashboard`
- Invalid sessions are automatically cleared

## 🔍 Verification Steps

1. **Check System Settings**: Verify `minimum_charge` is set to 100 in `system_settings` table
2. **Test Small Areas**: Create test users with 10m², 15m², 25m² spaces and verify 100 BHD costs
3. **Test Large Areas**: Create test users with 100m²+ spaces and verify calculated costs
4. **Test Session Validation**: Login and try to access `/login` page
5. **Check All Dashboards**: Verify costs display correctly in admin, supporter, and warehouse detail pages

## ✅ Implementation Status

- ✅ Minimum 100 BHD rule implemented in all cost calculators
- ✅ Session validation added to login page
- ✅ System settings update script created
- ✅ Test script created for verification
- ✅ Documentation completed

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
