# 🔧 Calculator Pricing Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The calculator was using incorrect or missing pricing data. The issue was:
- **Missing Real Price List**: Calculator wasn't using the actual pricing from `database/sitra-warehouse-schema.sql`
- **Database Schema Mismatch**: Tables and columns didn't match the expected structure
- **Hardcoded Fallbacks**: Calculator had fallback logic instead of using real data

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Real Price List Applied**

The calculator now uses the **actual pricing data** from the Sitra Warehouse schema:

#### **🏢 Ground Floor Pricing**
| Area Band | Short Term | Long Term | Very Short |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Small units** (1-999 m²) | 3.500 BHD/m² | 3.000 BHD/m² | 4.500 BHD/m² |
| **1,000-1,499 m²** | 3.000 BHD/m² | 2.800 BHD/m² | - |
| **1,500 m² +** | 2.800 BHD/m² | 2.600 BHD/m² | - |

#### **🏢 Mezzanine Pricing**
| Area Band | Short Term | Long Term | Very Short |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Small units** (1-999 m²) | 2.800 BHD/m² | 2.400 BHD/m² | 3.600 BHD/m² |
| **1,000-1,499 m²** | 2.400 BHD/m² | 2.240 BHD/m² | - |
| **1,500 m² +** | 2.240 BHD/m² | 2.080 BHD/m² | - |

## 🛠️ How to Fix the Calculator

### **Step 1: Run the Pricing Fix Script**
```bash
node fix-calculator-pricing.js
```

This script will:
- ✅ Clear existing incorrect pricing data
- ✅ Insert the **REAL price list** from the schema
- ✅ Configure EWA settings with correct values
- ✅ Update system settings
- ✅ Set up optional services

### **Step 2: Verify the Fix**
```bash
node verify-pricing.js
```

This will show you:
- 📊 Current pricing rates by space type and tenure
- ⚙️ System settings status
- ⚡ EWA settings verification
- 🔍 Any remaining issues

### **Step 3: Test the Calculator**
1. Go to `/calculator` in your application
2. Try different combinations:
   - **Ground Floor** with different area sizes
   - **Mezzanine** space
   - **Very Short**, **Short**, and **Long** terms
3. Verify the pricing matches the tables above

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Ground Floor - 100 m² - Short Term**
- Monthly Rate: **3.500 BHD/m²** = 350 BHD/month
- Min Chargeable: **30 m²** (since 100 > 30, no minimum charge applied)
- Package Starting: **105 BHD**

### **Mezzanine - 200 m² - Long Term**
- Monthly Rate: **2.400 BHD/m²** = 480 BHD/month
- Min Chargeable: **35 m²** (since 200 > 35, no minimum charge applied)
- Package Starting: **84 BHD**

### **Very Short Term - 50 m²**
- Daily Rate: **4.500 BHD/m²** (Ground Floor) or **3.600 BHD/m²** (Mezzanine)
- Min Chargeable: **25 m²**
- Duration calculated in **days** instead of months

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Script fails with permission errors**
```bash
# Solution: Check your Supabase permissions
# Make sure your service key has full access to the database
```

### **Issue: Pricing still shows old values**
```bash
# Solution: Clear browser cache and reload the calculator page
# The calculator loads pricing data on page load
```

### **Issue: "No pricing rates found"**
```bash
# Solution: Run the fix script again
node fix-calculator-pricing.js
```

### **Issue: Very Short term not working**
```bash
# Solution: Check that Very Short rates exist
node verify-pricing.js
```

## 📋 Pricing Logic Explained

### **Area Band Selection**
- **1-999 m²** = Small units band
- **1,000-1,499 m²** = Medium band
- **1,500 m²+** = Large band

### **Tenure Types**
- **Short Term**: < 1 year (12 months)
- **Long Term**: ≥ 1 year (12+ months)
- **Very Short**: Special daily rates (typically < 1 month)

### **Minimum Chargeable Area**
- Each band has a minimum area you must pay for
- If your requested area < minimum, you pay for the minimum
- Example: Request 20 m², minimum 30 m² → Pay for 30 m²

### **Package Pricing**
- Fixed starting prices for certain area bands
- Ensures minimum revenue per booking
